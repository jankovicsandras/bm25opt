The site has about 1,400 articles and there are ads on it. The way we are displaying the ads is through conditional logic which looks at the $_SERVER[\"HTTP_USER_AGENT\"] variable and checks to see if it's desktop or mobile. The ads are only supposed to show on desktop so if it's mobile, it just doesn't echo is out. I've used the code from the answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4117555/simplest-way- to-detect-a-mobile-device, though I know there is a native WordPress function wp_is_mobile(), but it's based on the same idea. It works fine on most posts but there are a bunch of posts that it doesn't work on (i.e. the ad shows on mobile). I could not figure it out and ended up thinking that maybe the $_SERVER[\"HTTP_USER_AGENT\"] variable wasn't being set on those pages for some reason. I used 'print_r($_SERVER)' to inspect and as soon as I loaded the page with those variables printed, the ad disappeared. Every subsequent page visit after that on that specific post does not show the ad. It's as if the SERVER variables weren't recognized until I printed them. Another thing is that when it was showing the ad on mobile and then I'd log into WordPress on mobile and go to that post, it wouldn't show (which is what I want). So the only time it was showing was on some of the posts only when logged out of WordPress. I am using W3 Total Cache and I don't know if that would affect server variables but it should be noted since I know that plugin can cause little things here and there. Any ideas on why this would be happening?\n",

What's the correct way to remove the Jetpack link? \n",

I can check the current username of the logged in user and echo it which returns the correct username just fine on the page. I can also add a page ID by adding the page ID like this: `$other_page = 890;` and it pulls in the custom field data from the correct company page (890 being one of the company pages). So everything works as it should independently, just not when I want to use the logged in username as the name of the page (namely $other_page).

What I'm trying to achieve: ACF data is pulled from a WP page which has the same name as the current logged in user. Basically I will have a WP page set up for each company. I will create a login for each company with an appropriate username. The name of the company page will be the exact same name as the username I create. It will have Advanced Custom Fields entered with data. I want to dynamically pull in the ACF data from the company page based on the current user logged in into my page template. So if company A are logged in, I want them to view the custom fields from company A's page. Company B log in and view the custom fields from the company B page. So far, I have this:                   <?php           global $user_login;           get_currentuserinfo();           $username = $current_user->user_login;           $other_page = $username;         ?>         <p><?php the_field('my_custom_field', $other_page); ?></p>      Which in theory should work, but it just doesn't. I can check the current username of the logged in user and echo it which returns the correct username just fine on the page. I can also add a page ID by adding the page ID like this: `$other_page = 890;` and it pulls in the custom field data from the correct company page (890 being one of the company pages). So everything works as it should independently, just not when I want to use the logged in username as the name of the page (namely $other_page). I'm baffled with this so any help would be greatly appreciated. \n",

Essentially, I have created a custom walker class for my nav menu and I have manually added a menu entry directing users to \"/articles\" which is a custom post type archive page. (BTW, as far as I know there is no way to have these custom post type archive pages included within the left hand selection correct?) Anyway... so, I have added the menu entry by using the custom link dialog box and my custom walker correctly highlights that nav menu entry when you click it/visit the \"/articles\" page. The problem I am having here is that when you select one of the news items this \"/articles\" menu link is no longer selected. So the question here is: what would I need to change in my custom walker class (code I am using is included below) to append a class to the menu when your on of those post pages. It would seem to me that this functionality should be built into wordpress for custom post types. For example, the class \"current_page_parent\" is appended to a parent page if you visit one of the subpages. I thought there would be something like \"current_post_parent\" or \"current_custom_post_parent\" but this does not seem to exist as far as I can tell. So team, any idea how I can add this functionality? **My Custom Walker Menu**               // COMPANY - RIGHT MENU - CUSTOM MENU WALKER     class Company_Menu_Bar_Walker extends Walker_Nav_Menu {     function start_el(&$output, $item, $depth, $args) {         global $wp_query;         $indent = ( $depth ) ? str_repeat( \"\\t\", $depth ) : '';         $class_names = $value = '';         $classes = empty( $item->classes ) ? array() : (array) $item->classes;         $current_indicators = array('current-menu-item', 'current-menu-parent', 'current_page_item', 'current_page_parent');         $newClasses = array();         foreach($classes as $original_class) {         //check if it's indicating the current page, otherwise we don't need the class             if (in_array($original_class, $current_indicators)) {                 array_push($newClasses, $original_class);             }         }         $class_names = join( ' ', apply_filters( 'nav_menu_css_class', array_filter( $newClasses), $item ) );         if($class_names!='') $class_names = ' class=\"'. esc_attr( $class_names ) .

            "|BM25opt  | 163 | 13.954581 | I have an interesting problem I am trying to solve here regarding a custom nav menu. Essentially, I have created a custom walker class for my nav menu and I have manually added a menu entry directing users to \"/articles\" which is a custom post type archive page. (BTW, as far as I know there is no way to have these custom post type archive pages included within the left hand selection correct?) Anyway... so, I have added the menu entry by using the custom link dialog box and my custom walker correctly highlights that nav menu entry when you click it/visit the \"/articles\" page. The problem I am having here is that when you select one of the news items this \"/articles\" menu link is no longer selected. So the question here is: what would I need to change in my custom walker class (code I am using is included below) to append a class to the menu when your on of those post pages. It would seem to me that this functionality should be built into wordpress for custom post types. For example, the class \"current_page_parent\" is appended to a parent page if you visit one of the subpages. I thought there would be something like \"current_post_parent\" or \"current_custom_post_parent\" but this does not seem to exist as far as I can tell. So team, any idea how I can add this functionality? **My Custom Walker Menu**               // COMPANY - RIGHT MENU - CUSTOM MENU WALKER     class Company_Menu_Bar_Walker extends Walker_Nav_Menu {     function start_el(&$output, $item, $depth, $args) {         global $wp_query;         $indent = ( $depth ) ? str_repeat( \"\\t\", $depth ) : '';         $class_names = $value = '';         $classes = empty( $item->classes ) ? array() : (array) $item->classes;         $current_indicators = array('current-menu-item', 'current-menu-parent', 'current_page_item', 'current_page_parent');         $newClasses = array();         foreach($classes as $original_class) {         //check if it's indicating the current page, otherwise we don't need the class             if (in_array($original_class, $current_indicators)) {                 array_push($newClasses, $original_class);             }         }         $class_names = join( ' ', apply_filters( 'nav_menu_css_class', array_filter( $newClasses), $item ) );         if($class_names!='') $class_names = ' class=\"'. esc_attr( $class_names ) .

Here's what my admin capabilities looks like for one of the admin users:               wp_capabilities      a:1:{s:13:\"administrator\";b:1;}     wp_user_level        10      That is what a freshly created admin user looks like. The issue is not logging in. The issue is that once logged in, I cannot see any upgrade options for Wordpress core or any plugins. It's like the \"upgrade\" capability has completely vanished for some reason. This is what shows under \"Plugins\" in the admin: ![Plugins left nav](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RaL4a.png) This is what I get when manually trying to browse to update the core at `/wp- admin/update-core.php`: ![Attempting to update core](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SfmXL.png) Seriously ready to pull my hair out guys. Never seen this one up close and personal like this. Totally new to me, and I deal almost exclusively with Wordpress.\n",
